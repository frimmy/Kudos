Hackbright final project - employee recognition web app


Overview
=====
This is a webapp designed to use internally at your company. It provides a central place for employees to post recognition for other employee's work, whereas it might go unnoticed otherwise. You have a main feed where all posts are displayed and then clicking on either a team or specific person will show more information, as well as any posts they have been tagged in. A great way for new employees to see what everyone has been working on.
